Tools such as the Green Algorithms online calculator have proven useful for researchers, research software engineers (RSEs) and organisations to understand the environmental impacts of their work, but some important questions remain: To what extent does carbon tracking incentivise green computing practices? Or how can we make sure it does?

# Study aims

To empirically evaluate the effectiveness of carbon reporting tools in reducing the environmental impacts of scientific computing, we are currently (spring 2025) designing an international multi-centre study called E-SCOUT. As part of the study, we will compare the effectiveness of different types of feedback for different user groups, leveraging a new open source dashboard for high-performance computing (HPC) that we have built.

# Working closely with our users

Reflecting its user-centred approach, E-SCOUT will use co-design throughout all stages to ensure that the feedback interventions are tailored to the usersâ€™ needs, goals and constraints. We are also planning to set up a steering group that brings together people with diverse perspectives for reflection and decision-making.

# How can I get involved?

If you work for a research performing organisation (RPO), such as a university, that uses HPC, and would be interested in getting involved, register your interest here. We also welcome interest from individuals for our steering group. You can simply register interest [here](https://zcmp.eu/nvfL).
