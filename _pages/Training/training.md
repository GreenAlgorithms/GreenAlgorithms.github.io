We regroup here resources that can be used to learn more about green computing, some from us, but also links to other websites and initiative ([suggestions](https://github.com/GreenAlgorithms/GreenAlgorithms.github.io/issues) on what to add to the list welcome!).

## Other resources available online

- You can check the carbon intensity of a location live on [electricitymaps.com](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map).
- To tackle the carbon footprint of "wet" labs, there is the [LEAF framework](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sustainable/leaf/take-part-leaf).
- The [1point5 lab](https://labos1point5.org/) initiative is an international, cross-disciplinary collective of French academics who share a common goal: to better understand and reduce the environmental impact of research.
- Curious about the energy usage of Bitcoin? There is a tool for that [here](https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index).
